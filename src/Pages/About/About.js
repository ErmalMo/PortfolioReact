        What can a “full-stack web developer” do, you ask?
        I can conjur a website from nothing into existence, fully formed.
        I do not use tricks, nor is this magic. I specialize in manipulating 
        the very fabric of the web, its raw materials of HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and SVG. Linux servers serve me, domains are my domain,
        and certificates are certain.
        Open-source technologies empower this process.
        My art & design background informs ideation to design through to 
        implementation.
        I will always advocate for the user of my interfaces; accessibility is not optional.
        I can plan, design, build, launch, and maintain a website myself—did
